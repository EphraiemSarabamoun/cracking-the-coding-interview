There are INNER joins, LEFT joins, RIGHT joins, FULL joins, and CROSS joins. 
INNER joins keep only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
LEFT joins keep all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table.
RIGHT joins keep all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table.
FULL joins keep all the rows from both tables.
CROSS joins keep all the rows from both tables, but without matching.
