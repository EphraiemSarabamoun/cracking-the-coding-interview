A filing system has files and directories. Both of these can be considered classes. Files can have ids and other relevant info, including whether they are filed or not, and what directory they are in if they are filed.

 We need methods for adding, removing, and moving files and directories. We might also want methods to locate a file by its id and to get all files in a given directory.
