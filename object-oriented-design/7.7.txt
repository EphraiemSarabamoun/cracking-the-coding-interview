To design a chat, I would use classes for Users, Chats, and Messages. There would be methods to add/remove users, add/remove chats, and add/remove messages in a given chat. There would also be methods to get users, chats, and messages. 
One challenge would be somehow tying the user class with the correct user. This can be done by means of a login page.
