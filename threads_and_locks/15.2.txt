A context switch is the OS pausing one thread/process and resuming another:

Save state: Program counter (PC), registers, stack pointer to Thread Control Block (TCB) or Process Control Block (PCB).
Select next: Via scheduler (e.g., round-robin).
Restore state: Load from TCB/PCB, switch to user mode.
For threads: Faster, no memory map change; processes: Update page tables.
